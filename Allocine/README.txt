# Welcome to My Allocine
Allocine project entails codes used for quering a database a database using SQL.

## Task
This code contains SQL queries to retrieve data from a database that contains information about movies, actors, directors, genres, and reviews. The queries use various clauses such as SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY to extract specific information from the database.

## Description
The queries cover a wide range of questions, including displaying all actors, genres, and movies, finding information about specific movies, actors, and directors, and retrieving information about reviewers and their ratings.

The queries are organized in a dictionary called requests, where each key corresponds to a specific question and its value is the SQL query to retrieve the information.

## Installation
No extra Installation is required to test this project. 

## Usage
To use this code, you need to have access to a database that contains information about movies, actors, directors, genres, and reviews, and you need to have a tool to execute SQL queries. You can copy and paste the queries into your SQL tool or run them programmatically using a library like sqlite3 in Python.

Note that some of the queries use functions specific to the SQLite database, such as strftime, which might not be available in other database systems. Also, some of the queries might return duplicates or null values depending on the data in the database. It is important to understand the structure of the database and the meaning of the queries to interpret the results correctly.
