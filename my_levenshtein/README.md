## Task
The line problem is identifying the difference in two 
strings if it exists and return the value of the number of differences.

## Description
I solved the problem by using if statement to check if the the of the 
strings are equal, if it is not, it will return a value of -1 else it will use a for loop to identify the difference,
and it will return the number of differences.

## Installation
you can run this project on any IDE that
support node js. 

## Usage
it returns a value. when the strings length is greater than each other, its return -1.
```

```s1 symbolises string 1 while s2 stands for strng 2.
